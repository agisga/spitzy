# Spitzy

![Spitzy](spitzy.jpg?raw=true "Optional Title")

Spitzy is this cute pomeranian.
Spitzy reads backwards as *yztips*, which translates into:

*Y*our *Z*appy-*T*appy *I*nitial value *P*artial (and ordinary) differential equation *S*olver

Now, spitzy is also a ruby library in which I am building a comprehensive collection of numerical methods for differential equations, written in pure Ruby.
To my knowledge, apart from an [interface with Fortran code](https://rubygems.org/gems/rb-daspk/versions/0.0.7-x86-mswin32-60), there currently does not exist another differential equation solver gem for Ruby.

<!--
Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/spitzy`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

TODO: Delete this and the text above, and describe your gem

## Installation

<!--
Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'spitzy'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install spitzy
-->

This will probably work:

```
git clone https://github.com/agisga/spitzy.git
cd spitzy/
rake install
```

## Usage

* [Advection equation](http://agisga.github.io/Advection-Equation/)

<!--
## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release` to create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
